Hello, I'm PE, and this is my little corner. I'm primarily a front-end developer interested in building neat libraries, pretty graphical interfaces, and exploring new territories in the ever-expanding dev universe. Here you'll find everything I've made and will make for the general public. I've chosen to keep the most horrific things for myself.

Here's a quick rundown of what I'm all about:

* [**lib**](https://github.com/PicturElements/lib)&nbsp;&nbsp;My core libraries, all collected in a monorepo
* [**Codepen**](https://codepen.io/PicturElements/)&nbsp;&nbsp;My old scribbles and experiments
* [**GH Pages**](https://github.com/PicturElements/picturelements.github.io)&nbsp;&nbsp;Proof that past me was an unhinged maniac
